## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Install LaTeX

First, make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed:

- **macOS**: Install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/).
- **Windows**: Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).
- **Linux**: Install TeX Live using your package manager.

### 2️⃣ Open Terminal

Navigate to the folder containing your `.tex` file. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/resume-folder
```

### 3️⃣ Compile the LaTeX File
Run the following command to compile your resume:

pdflatex filename.tex
    Replace filename.tex with your actual LaTeX file name.
    This will generate filename.pdf in the same folder.

Open your PDF with a viewer:

    open filename.pdf          # macOS
